# CPE106L - B2 (Software Design)
# Group 6

For this project, the researchers will create a GUI python script that will help the
user in conveying raw csv Covid-19 “Big Data” into a format that the user can easily
understand. The concept and information that they will use is about the virus, COVID-19.
They will feature the Philippines as their sample country. The researchers will have
a feature that will let the users see how many new cases of Covid-19 are there in the
Philippines, the total number of COVID-19 Cases in the Philippines day and the total
number of tested people for COVID-19 in the Philippines and the total number of cases
in the Philippines as a graph over time. Once these buttons are clicked, it will show a
graph that tells the statistics, based on what option that you have chosen.

**Features of the Software:**
	
• Friendly GUI
• Ability to display the newest Cases in the Philippines as of the current day
• Ability to display the Total number of Cases in the Philippines as of the current day
• Ability to display the Total number of people Tested in the Philippines
• Ability to show a graph of the total number of cases from the start of the pandemic (dec 2020) to the current day.


**Recommendations:**

Further development on the code can be made to clean up the plot in the TotalCasesPlot Function with a clear date start and end. We recommend also in adding a function where it takes the users’ desired country and displays the same statistics in the same functions.
